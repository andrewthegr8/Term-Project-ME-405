Romi Control Architecture 
======================================

This website contains hardware and software documentation for a project revolving around
a small differential drive robot (Romi). It was completed as part of a course (ME 405) at
Cal Poly SLO.

The primary project objective was for the robot to quickly and reliably
complete an obstacle course.

Robot features include

* Realtime State Estimation via a State Space Observer with Feedback
* Line Following Capabilities via Analog IR Sesnors
* Path Planning with Velocity and Heading Control
* Realtime Transmission of Telemetry Data to a PC via Bluetooth
* Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
