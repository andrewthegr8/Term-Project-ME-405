Differential Drive Robot (MicroPython)
======================================

This project contains MicroPython software and documentation for a small
differential drive robot. It was completed as part of a course (ME 405) at
Cal Poly SLO.

The primary project objective was for the robot to quickly and reliably
complete a small obstacle course.

Robot features include
* Realtime State Estimation via a State Space Observer with Feedback
* Line Following Capabilities via Analog IR Sesnors
* Path Planning with Velocity and Heading Control
* Realtime Transmission of Telemetry Data to a PC via Bluetooth
* Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
